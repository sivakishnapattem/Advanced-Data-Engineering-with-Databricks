Also keep in mind the above approach is extreme. A slightly less permissive compromise can be made, while still leveraging privilege inheritance, with the following two grants. Note, you don't need to run these statements; they're merely provided as an example to illustrate the different types of privilege structures you can create that take advantage of inheritance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Dynamic views provide the ability to do fine-grained access control of columns and rows within a table, conditional on the principal running the query. Dynamic views are an extension to standard views that allow us to do things like:\n",
    "* partially obscure column values or redact them entirely\n",
    "* omit rows based on specific criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Access control with dynamic views is achieved through the use of functions within the definition of the view. These functions include:\n",
    "* `current_user()`: returns the email address of the user querying the view\n",
    "* `is_account_group_member()`: returns TRUE if the user querying the view is a member of the specified group\n",
    "* `is_member()`: returns TRUE if the user querying the view is a member of the specified workspace-local group\n",
    "\n",
