    "## Automated Deployment with Databricks Asset Bundles\n",
    "This course provides a comprehensive review of DevOps principles and their application to Databricks projects. It begins with an\n",
    "overview of core DevOps, DataOps, continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), and testing, and explores how these\n",
    "principles can be applied to data engineering pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The course then focuses on continuous deployment within the CI/CD process, examining tools like the Databricks REST API, SDK,\n",
    "and CLI for project deployment. You will learn about Databricks Asset Bundles (DABs) and how they fit into the CI/CD process. You’ll\n",
    "dive into their key components, folder structure, and how they streamline deployment across various target environments in\n",
    "Databricks. You will also learn how to add variables, modify, validate, deploy, and execute Databricks Asset Bundles for multiple\n",
    "environments with different configurations using the Databricks CLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the course introduces Visual Studio Code as an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) for building, testing, and\n",
    "deploying Databricks Asset Bundles locally, optimizing your development process. The course concludes with an introduction to\n",
    "automating deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions to enhance the CI/CD workflow with Databricks Asset Bundles.\n",
    "By the end of this course, you will be equipped to automate Databricks project deployments with Databricks Asset Bundles, improving\n",
    "efficiency through DevOps practices.\n",
